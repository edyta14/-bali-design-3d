    "detailDescription": "This table begins as a single piece of aged teak wood — its organic edges untouched, its grain telling decades of growth. At 10 cm of solid thickness, it carries a quiet authority that transforms any room it enters. The base is matte-black steel, finished with a gold powder coating: a subtle tribute to the golden light of Dubai. No two slabs are alike. What you see is what nature carved.",
